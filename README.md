This is a Qt project, in order to run this you have to have Qt installed!

Remember to **uncomment** following line in the HW.h if you're on Windows or Linux platform.......
```
#include <GL/glu.h>
```

<strike>HW3 might not work properly on Mac I couldn't find out why. But if you can't display image on Mac, try Linux and Windows.....</strike>


Solve the issue which image is not showing properly on Mac.....
